# Restaurant Single Page 
Created a responsive single page website for a restaurant

**Link to project:** https://arlo-restaurant.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I worked on this project as a challenge to myself to create a fully responsive website, all within vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  This is also the first time I used modules to keep my code modular and separate. I also used classes to hide certain parts of the site when they are not in use, or being hidden while another "page" loads its content. Being able to use industry standards when creating an app was the goal.

## Optimizations

Was able to minify my code so that it runs quick in the browser, and allows for the responsive site feel fluid.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how modules can be effective in keeping code organized and separate, to allow the project to flow while not being overwhelming. I also learned how to minify my code so it can be optimized for the web. 

I also learned how to hide certain content when loading a new part of the single webpage, through JavaScript and CSS


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
